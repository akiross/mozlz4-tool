This project is incomplete, currently only "mozlz4cat" is implemented. (I'll make a "mozlz4c" to compress data back if I need it or someone opens a pull request for it.)

To build, install cargo and run `cargo build --release`.

To use, find the compiled binary (default `target/release/mozlz4cat`) and run it with your mozlz4 file path.
